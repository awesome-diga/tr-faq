# Contributing

This project is just starting out and building a community. Our guidelines are therefore first draft suggestions on
how things can work. If you feel that there is a better way, please do reach out to the maintainers. Ideally via an
issue here on GitHub, that allows us to discuss matters in a way that enables the whole community to contribute to
the discussion.

Discussions and interactions on the repository can be in English or German. We do encourage you to contribute in English as we believe that this will ensure the biggest reach.

## Contributing Content

If you want to contribute content, you can create a Pull Request (PR) to this repository with the content you would like to contribute.
Please make sure that you are okay with releasing the content into the world under the [Content License](./CONTENT_LICENSE.md) of the project.

When contributing content to the FAQ Page, we currently only accept submissions in German. If that is not a language you are comfortable in for such contributions, please reach out to one of the maintainers. We will help you out. For details on this you can refer to [this issue](https://github.com/awesome-diga/tr-faq/issues/4).

### On maximizing contribution value

Here are some tips on how to make your content contribution as valuable to the community as it can be?

1. Make sure that your content includes information on where you sourced the information from. This can also be your own thoughts or analysis/experience. This information is important for others to understand how to contextualize the information provided.
2. If you are directly quoting an organization, please point that out, for example, through the use of Markdown Quotations (`>`). Again, this will help the readers with context around how to understand/interpret an answer.
3. If you are paraphrasing, please differentiate between the parts you are paraphrasing and the parts where you are interpreting what is being said. This again is for context.

As you can see, the theme here is to not only provide answers, but also to help people contextualize those answers.
From numerous talks we had, this is a major issue within the set of people we talked to.

## Contributing to Issues/Discussions

For now, we are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/awesome-diga/tr-faq/issues) to discuss all kinds of
potential contributions.
Starting or participating in discussions is a valuable contribution in and of itself.

While interacting with others, please keep our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in mind.

### What can Issues be about?

Issues can be about concrete questions that you want to ask about content or the TR in general.
Use them if you do not have an answer; you can already contribute to content as PR, or want to discuss
content that is already there.

If you feel that a discussion has reached the point where we can take it or the results to the FAQ content
section, feel free to open a PR containing the outcomes of the discussion and mention the Issue in that PR.

Issues can also be about things that you feel should be changed about the site. For example, if you fund a bug or
would like to discuss adding a feature before working on a PR for that.

## Contributing Code

If you are one of the people willing and able to contribute code. Please open an issue for discussions if you are planning a bigger contribution, like a new feature. If you are only fixing a minor thing, a PR with some context in the description is likely going to be enough. Check out the [Templates](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/) if you need/want inspiration on how a PR could/should look.
