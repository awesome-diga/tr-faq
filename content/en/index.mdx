# BSI DiGA TR-03161 Questions and Answers

This knowledge base serves as a structured and transparent collection of information, frequently asked questions (FAQs),
established good practices, and recognized procedures related to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) procedures in the context of digital health applications (DiGA).

## Background

Current communication between DiGA manufacturers and testing institutes and the BSI takes place primarily individually
via email. This leads to redundant communication, loss of information, and a lack of transparency.

## Objective

The goal of this knowledge base is to document central information and best practices in a publicly accessible manner in order to provide manufacturers and testing institutes with an efficient and transparent source of information.

## Implementation

- Content is managed as Markdown documents in a GitHub repository.
- Participants can independently contribute content or suggest changes.
- The final integration of the content is carried out by a dedicated team with merge rights.
- The content is also made available via a statically generated website to increase accessibility.

## Participation Opportunities

Interested parties can contribute new content directly to the GitHub repository or add to and improve existing content.
For example, via the "Edit this page on GitHub" link on the right side of every page.
